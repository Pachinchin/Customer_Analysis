# RFM Modeling
Understanding customer segmentation is an invaluable skill in business. It is not news to say Customers are different. i.e the busying behaviour varies. Segmenting them for proper targeting can lead to increase customer lifetime value. In this project, we try to apply the RFM model to the superstore data set from Tableau. The customer ranking is grouped based on the RFM(- Recency, Frequency and Monetary)value. They are then classified into different loyalty groups (Platinium, Gold, Silver, bronze).
