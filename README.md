# RFM Modeling
Understanding customer segmentation is an invaluable skill in business. To people who understand busuiness, it isn't news to say Customers are different. i.e the buying behaviour varies. Segmenting them for proper targeting can lead to increase customer lifetime value.which is a goal most buisiness leaders want. 
In this project, we try to apply the RFM model to the superstore data set from Tableau. The customer ranking will be grouped based on the RFM( Recency, Frequency and Monetary)value. They are then classified into different loyalty groups (Platinium, Gold, Silver, bronze).
